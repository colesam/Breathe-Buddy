                            My name is Sam Cole and I am a senior at the University of St.
                            Thomas. I am graduating in May with a double major in Computer
                            and Information Science and German.

                        <p>
                            Once I graduate I plan on working as a Web Developer / UI
                            Designer. I want to work with some of the more modern JavaScript
                            frameworks like React or Vue. JavaScript is my favorite programming
                            language because of all of the innovation that is happening right 
                            now with these new frameworks.

                            My name is Mathew Schlichting. I am currently {{mattAge}} and I graduated from the University
                            of St. Thomas in May of 2018. I have been programing since I was 15 when I took my first
                            college level computer science course. I fell in love with computers ever since. I have taken
                            as many computer science courses as possible during my college career. In addition, I graduated
                            with a 3.99 GPA and Summa Cum Laude honors. I have done research for the University of St.
                            Thomas which was published in August of 2017.

                            <p>
                                AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that we used to get two way data-binding within our
                                application. This can be seen in the location controls when the center of the map is
                                changed. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We also used <em>ng-includes</em> to break our site into two html sections, one for the application
                                and one for the project about page. By using these ng-includes we are able to load these two different
                                sections without refreshing the entire page. Test it out by switching between them!
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h4 class="text-md">JQuery</h4>
                            <p>
                                JQuery is a prerequisite for the Select2 and Bootstrap frameworks. Because it is already included and
                                its syntax is much cleaner than regular JS, weopted to use it for DOM manipulation also.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="margin-bottom-md">
                            <h4 class="text-md">Select2</h4>
                            <p>
                                Select2 is a framework that uses JQuery to convert regular select inputs into more user friendly
                                interfaces. Select2 is used to control the particle settings in our data filter.

                            <h4 class="text-md">Bootstrap</h4>
                            <p>
                                We used Bootstrap for it's grid system. The grid system and Bootstrap's flexbox classes allowed us to
                                set up the user interface for our application without writing too much custom CSS.

# Breathe-Buddy
An air quality web application built using AngularJS.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This project is a web application I built with my partner, Mathew Schlichting, for our CISC 375 Web Development course at 
  the University of St. Thomas.
</p>
<p>
  The project was built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4.0, and AngularJS. It combines the 
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a> with the 
  <a href="https://docs.openaq.org/" target="_blank">Open AQ API</a> to create a web application that shows the 
  user information about the air quality of a given location. 
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

  <li>Binds map location to location input boxes to update location when user clicks and drags map</li>
  <li>Allows user to select date within last 90 days to grab data from</li>
  <li>Populates a table with air quality measurements based off of location and date</li>
  <li>Shows a UI for filtering data by particle type or by minimum measurement per particle type</li>
  <li>Pops up measurement data when map marker is hovered over</li>
  <li>Clusters markers together when they occupy a small area on the map</li>
  <li>Features custom made cluster PNG files to match site theme</li>
  <li>Moves critical UI components inside the map on fullscreen mode</li>
  <li>Allows for heatmap display when only one particle type is selected</li>
  <li>Contains "About the Project" page with profile pictures of each partner and short bios</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Install</h2>

In order to use this application you will need to sign up for a <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key">Google Maps API Key</a>.

Once you have your API key you will want to download the files and serve them in your local development environment. 
Next, modify the `$scope.API_KEY` variable in `js/controllers/airQualityController.js` to use the API key you signed up for.
Finally, run the index.html file in the root directory to use the application.
